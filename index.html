                    <p> If I had to talk about kindness, I’d start with my parents.</p><p></p>They are the kindest souls I’ve ever known. If a relative needs help, they’re the first ones there. If a friend is in trouble, they’ll drop everything to lend a hand. If a neighbor’s second cousin’s dog needs a ride to the vet at 3 AM? Somehow, they’re involved.</p>
                    <p>Their kindness isn’t selective, it’s instinctive. My dad once helped a complete stranger push his broken-down car for three blocks in the middle of summer. I, on the other hand, consider it a major accomplishment if I remember to text my friend back within 24 hours.</p>
                    <p>Growing up with parents like this, kindness wasn’t just encouraged, it was expected. Naturally, I followed in their footsteps.</p>
                    <p>So, I was kind.</p>
                    <p>I helped.</p>
                    <p>I listened.</p>
                    <p>I forgave.</p>
                    <p>I showed up.</p>
                    <p>Until one day, I realized something: I wasn’t just kind, I was a human welcome mat.</p>
                    <p>I thought I was being a good person. But in reality, I had become everyone’s go-to problem solver. People wiped their problems on me and walked away feeling better, while I was left carrying the weight of their baggage.</p><br>

                    <h3>Kindness Without Boundaries Isn’t Kindness. It’s Self-Betrayal.</h3>
                    <p>Because here’s the thing about kindness:</p>
                    <p>It’s not about stretching yourself thin for everyone else.</p>
                    <p>It’s not about being available at the cost of your own well-being.</p>
                    <p>It’s about being good, not being used. And trust me, there’s a difference.</p>
                    <p>Too often, we confuse kindness with self-sacrifice. But kindness isn’t about depleting yourself for the sake of others. It’s about generosity that comes from abundance, not exhaustion.</p><br>
                   
                    <h3>The Energy of Kindness</h3>
                    <p>Let’s talk science.</p>
                    <p>According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be transferred or transformed.</p>
                    <p>Kindness works the same way.</p>
                    <p>When you choose kindness, you shift not just your own energy, but the energy around you. Studies show that acts of kindness release oxytocin, the “love hormone” that lowers blood pressure and reduces stress. One study even found that one good deed can inspire three more.</p>
                    <p>A single act of kindness can ripple outward, turning negativity into something lighter, softer, better.</p>
                    <p>And the best part?</p>
                    <p>Kindness doesn’t just change the world. <em>It changes you.</em></p> <br> 

                    <h3>A Simple Compliment</h3>
                    <p>A few months ago, I was at a coffee shop when I noticed a woman sitting alone. She looked anxious, constantly adjusting her dress, her eyes scanning the room like she wanted to disappear.</p>
                    <p>Something in me just knew. So, I walked up to her and said, <em>"I just wanted to tell you, I love your dress, it’s such a beautiful color on you."</em></p>
                    <p>Her face lit up instantly. She smiled, exhaled, and admitted she had been feeling self-conscious all morning.</p>
                    <p>That one small compliment changed her entire energy. That’s kindness.</p>
                    <p>It’s when you stand up for someone when no one else will.</p>
                    <p>It’s when you offer genuine encouragement instead of competing.</p>
                    <p>It’s when you listen, not just to respond, but to understand.</p>
                    <p>But here’s the tricky part…</p><br> 

                    <h3>Kindness Is Not the Same as Letting People Use You</h3>
                    <p>I used to live by the rule:</p>
                    <p><em>"If you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all."</em></p>
                    <p>But now, I have a new rule:</p>
                    <p><em>"If being kind to someone requires being unkind to yourself… walk away."</em></p>
                    <p>Because kindness should never be a one-way street.</p>
                    <p>There’s a difference between being a good person and being a person who is taken for granted.</p><br>

                     <h3> When Kindness Becomes a One-Way Street</h3> 
                     <p>A few years ago, I had a friend who used me as her personal therapist. Anytime she needed to vent, rant, or complain, I was there. But when I needed her? Radio silence. One night, she called me at 2 AM, sobbing over the same problem I had helped her with a dozen times before. I was exhausted, but I picked up the phone anyway. I stayed up for hours, comforting her.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, I woke up feeling drained. Resentful. And that’s when I had a hard conversation with myself. Was this kindness? Or was this self-sacrifice dressed up as kindness? So, I called my sensei aka, my parents. And they gave it to me straight:</p>
                     <p><em>"She’s not your friend. She’s your emotional leech. And you? You’re her 24/7 hotline. The problem isn’t that you’re kind it’s that you’re available for people who wouldn’t do the same for you."</em></p>
                     <p>That hit hard. But it was also liberating. Because I realized: In order to be kind to others, I don’t have to be unkind to myself. I can be kind to both.</p><br> 
                    
                    <h3> The Solution: Boundaries</h3>
                    <p>Kindness is not about overextending yourself. It’s not about saying yes to everything. It’s not about giving endlessly until you’re empty. It’s about knowing when to give and when to step back.</p>
                    <p>If you’re giving the same advice to the same person for the hundredth time, maybe it’s time to stop speaking and start observing. Because here’s the thing: People don’t change because of your words. They change because they want to. No amount of motivational speeches, TED Talks, or deep heart-to-hearts can make someone change unless they are ready to take action.</p>
                    <p>So, be kind. Be compassionate. But don’t set yourself on fire just to keep someone else warm.</p><br>

                    <h3>The Real Power of Kindness</h3>
                    <p>True kindness is not about pleasing people. It’s about bringing light into the world, without dimming your own. So, the next time someone mistakes your kindness for weakness, remind yourself:</p>
                    <p>You are kind, but not a doormat.</p>
                    <p>You are compassionate, but not a sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>You are giving, but not an emotional ATM.</p>
                    <p>Kindness is a gift, not a transaction. And the most important person you need to be kind to?</p>
                    <p>Yourself.</p>

                    <p>How many times have you been sitting with a group of friends, and suddenly, the conversation shifts to you as the punchline? Maybe someone mocks your ambitions, belittles your personality, or throws a personal jab masked as a joke. And when you react, when you show even the slightest discomfort, someone immediately rolls their eyes and says:</p>
                     <p><em>"Oh my god, relax."</em></p>
                     <p><em>"It’s just a joke, don’t take yourself so seriously."</em></p>
                     <p><em>"You’re too sensitive, learn to laugh at yourself."</em></p>
                     <p>And just like that, you’re made to feel like the problem. Maybe you even start questioning yourself. <em> Am I overreacting? Am I too uptight?</em> You try to let it slide because you don’t want to be <em>that</em> person. The easygoing one, the one who can “take a joke,” is always more likable, right? But here’s what no one tells you, when you stop taking yourself seriously, so does everyone else.</p> <br>

                    <h3> The Beginning of the Toxic Cycle </h3>
                     <p>It never starts big. It begins with the small stuff. The first time, you laugh along when someone calls you dumb. A few days later, it escalates to, <em>“Wow, you’re actually so slow.”</em> Next thing you know, they’re calling you useless. And you’re still laughing.</p>
                     <p>By the time you realize the weight of those words, they’ve already settled inside you, becoming a part of your own internal dialogue. Because that’s how it works, when you keep hearing something repeatedly, even if it started as a joke, it starts to feel true. And the people saying it? They start to believe it, too. What was once disguised as “just humor” turns into genuine disrespect.</p>
                     <p>The scariest part? You won’t even realize when it happens. The words that were once fleeting comments will start following you everywhere. They will show up in your thoughts when you fail, when you try something new, when you look at yourself in the mirror. You won’t need anyone to call you stupid anymore; you’ll be doing it to yourself.</p><br>

                     <h3> Why Do We Let This Happen? </h3>
                    <p>A big reason is validation. We all crave it in some form. There’s a deep-rooted need to be accepted, to belong. It’s why so many of us ignore discomfort just to fit in. You think that if you can just <em>laugh along</em>, maybe these people will finally like you. Maybe they’ll see you as fun, easygoing, someone who “gets it.”</p>
                    <p>And the saddest part? The validation never lasts. You could be the funniest, most agreeable person in the room, and yet the moment you leave, nothing changes. They don’t respect you more for taking the jokes well; they just see you as someone they can get away with disrespecting.</p>
                    <p>The need for external validation seeps into everything. You could hear a hundred compliments from your mom, but it won’t mean as much as a single compliment from a stranger. That’s the thing about validation, it feels more real when it comes from someone who hasn’t seen your struggles, someone who doesn’t know your flaws.</p>
                    <p>But here’s the truth: you don’t need someone else’s approval to believe in yourself. You don’t need a random person to tell you you’re smart or beautiful for it to be real. What if, for once, you just decided that you were enough? What if you stopped waiting for the world to validate you and validated yourself instead?</p><br> 
                    
                    <h3>How This Affects You in the Long Run</h3>
                     <p>Not taking yourself seriously isn’t just about allowing jokes at your expense. It bleeds into every aspect of your life. Your career, your relationships, your self-worth.</p>
                     <p>When you get used to brushing off disrespect, you start lowering your standards. You accept mistreatment in friendships because <em>“they don’t really mean it.”</em> You tolerate condescending bosses because <em>“that’s just how the industry works.”</em> You let people walk all over you because <em>“you don’t want to make a big deal out of it.”</em></p>
                     <p>And before you know it, you become someone who isn’t taken seriously anywhere, not at work, not in relationships, not even by yourself.</p>
                     <p>So, the question isn’t, <em>“Why should I take myself seriously?”</em> The real question is, <em>“What happens if I don’t?”</em></p><br>

                      <h3>What Can You Do Instead?</h3>
                     <p>The first step is to recognize the pattern. It’s easy to miss when it starts because it’s often subtle. But pay attention to how you feel in these interactions. Does the joke actually make you laugh, or do you feel the need to laugh because you don’t want to seem sensitive? If it’s the latter, that’s your cue.</p>
                     <p>Stop laughing along when you don’t find something funny. You don’t need to cause a scene or argue. Sometimes, a simple silence is enough to shift the power dynamic. When someone makes a passive-aggressive comment and expects you to play along, don’t give them the satisfaction. Let the silence sit. Make them feel the awkwardness of their own words.</p>
                     <p>If they persist, flip it on them. Ask, <em>“Oh, what do you mean by that?”</em> or <em>“I didn’t get the joke, explain it.”</em> Watch them scramble for an answer. People who rely on putting others down rarely expect to be questioned.</p>
                     <p>And most importantly, set boundaries and enforce them. If something makes you uncomfortable, say it. It doesn’t matter if it’s a friend, a family member, or a colleague. If they truly respect you, they’ll listen. And if they don’t? Then why are you so desperate for their validation in the first place?</p>
                     <p>At the end of the day, self-respect isn’t about being aggressive or confrontational. It’s about standing firm in how you allow others to treat you. Because when you take yourself seriously, the world has no choice but to follow. </p>
